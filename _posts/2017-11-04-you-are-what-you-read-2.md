_FYI: This is an old post from an old blog I kept in uni_

1. [Einstein, Bohr, and the origins of entanglement](https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/einstein-bohr-and-the-origins-of-entanglement) 
- Because we can all stand to learn some crazy physics, especially when it’s written so beautifully.
2. [Is There Something Odd About Being Single?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/modern-love-is-there-something-odd-about-being-single.html) 
- Because it’s relevant, and the NYTimes Modern Love column is amazing.
3. [Time Travel in Fiction Rundown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3zTfXvYZ9s&ab_channel=minutephysics) 
- MinutePhysics is a great channel, and this video (though not a minute long) is a fantastic representation of that.
4. [This Is How You Lose Her by Junot Diaz](https://www.bookdepository.com/This-is-How-You-Lose-Her/9780571294220) 
- [Diaz](https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/junot-diaz/) is a Dominican-America writer whose work carries the vastness of an entire culture somewhere between the lines. He also teaches at MIT – taking one of his classes is definitely a bucket list item!
5. [Seeing Earth from Outer Space](https://pudding.cool/2017/10/satellites/) 
- This is a lovely little summary of the history of satellites, and a gorgeous (albeit glitchy) example of data journalism. Just make sure you scroll slowly. I found the Pudding on my hunt for some more content sources, and I have not been disappointed thus far.
6. [Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/) 
- This is another one from The Pudding, which I actually stole from my brother’s Facebook wall. Not even mad. It’s mathsy but also designy – I’m a big, big fan.
7. [Obama The Conservationist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/obama-the-conservationist) 
- Honestly, I used this as a source in an essay I wrote(/am still writing) this week. Nothing like a lil Obama love to make you feel better about the state of the world. A couple of notes: NOT “Obama, the Conversationalist” or “The Obama Conservationist” though these are also valid article ideas. Also totally gave up on the design for the story screen for this one.

And our bonus: [Dodie’s “You” music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaIZE6-yUKs&ab_channel=dodieVEVO), shot entirely on Super8 in Paris by Bertie Gilbert, was a beautiful oasis in the middle of a crazy, assessment-ridden and emotionally frightening week. Also check out [Bertie’s break down of his process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOS61kfblE&ab_channel=BertieGilbert), which is just relaxing to watch, honestly.
