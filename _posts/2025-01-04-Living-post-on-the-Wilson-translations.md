title: On the Wilson Translations
---
Emily Wilson's translations of the Odyssey and the Iliad are great contributions to the canon. 

- There is no perfect or "true" translation. However, we are fortunate to have many translations of ancient texts; they allow us to consider the language and literature from many vantage points. You should read many translations. 
- Wilson's translations are ambitious in form and in their context.
- They are also often lyrical and beautiful.
- The translator's note for the Odyssey is worth a read. It's clear that Wilson has questioned older biases in the translations. It's also clear she has brought her own to the text. Both of these are fine (see the first point).
- [The restrictions Wilson puts on herself in her translation of the Odyssey](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalEducation/comments/woixd8/comment/l88z73p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) are a result of the ambition. The syllabic + line restrictions conflict, however, and undermine the translation.
- Wilson clearly does not hate men generally or Homer specifically. What a bizarre thing to say.
- It is important that she's the first woman to translate the texts and publish those translations. Don't you think it's strange that hadn't happened yet?
- A lot of this discourse is clearly identity-driven backlash against an intelligent, hardworking person doing quality work. 

Ungenerous reflections on The Discourse:
- People seem to need something to be written in a high register to think it is Good.
- People seem not to have read these translations past the first page of The Odyssey.
- People seem to really struggle with (ie. chuck tantrums when introduced to) the idea of a complex character; there is some sort of Disney-hero version of Odysseus living in people's minds.
- People who say things like "Wilson hates Homer" show their hand. What a genuinely ridiculous, thoughtless thing to say.
