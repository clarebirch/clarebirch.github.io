2024 was a big year. Weddings, funerals, big changes, small changes, new horizons, rest, great books, great music, etc. Every few months I look back at myself from 3 months ago and I do not recognise her. 

I am delighted by how much great stuff---knowledge, media, culture, music, opinion, food, history, personality---there is to imbibe. The more I read, the more there is to read; the more I listen, the more there is to hear; the more I think, the more there is to consider and dream up. You could glut yourself on it---part of why creation is oh-so important. Good lesson for the year. 

Anyway, these are the best things I read/watched/listened to/ate this year. I consumed a bunch of crap, but this is what I'd like to remember!
### {A} Books
My favourite books I read this year, specifically those that are liable to be reread
- [The Fellowship of the Ring](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-the-lord-of-the-rings-part-one-j-r-r-tolkien/16648293?ean=9780547928210) - J. R. R. Tolkien (r)

Suffering from too-many-books---have made a gentle list for next year. Still, I am always keen for recommendations!!
### {B} Poetry
> 
> "But, I will say this, it does something, doesn’t it? Poetry. It does something to your brain. Pokes a finger in and wiggles around inside it." ([Hari Berrow](https://hariberrow.substack.com/p/hi-im-hari-i-read-a-poem-and-now))

### {C} Written materials on the internet

Hard to cut these down to most interesting for me this year. Strong runners up. Wasn't too enamoured with anything that hit the Twitter feeds very hard, though [Ruxandra's Substack](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/) hit a very impressive stride this year.

### {F} Other listens
I am not much of a podcast-listener but thought these ones rocked
- [Richard Butler - Nuclear Diplomacy at the End of History](https://josephnoelwalker.com/richard-butler-160/) - The Joe Walker Podcast
- [Dropping Out With Sam Reich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjw-zjLOXDI) - Roll for Persuasion

### {G} Recipes
Things I have cooked the most, or that have been very special, or that have just been really good:
- Yotam Ottolenghi's Chicken with Miso, Ginger and Lime from [Simple](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ottolenghi-simple-a-cookbook-yotam-ottolenghi/12838994?ean=9781607749165), though online [here](https://nothingbutonions.com/2020/05/chicken-with-miso-ginger-and-lime/). Great weeknight dinner, super easy in a dutch oven.
- Nagi's (ie. Recipe Tin Eats ie. Australia's hero) canned tuna pasta [here](https://www.recipetineats.com/canned-tuna-pasta/) ; if you add olives and diced tomatoes you have a nice little puttanesca (with tuna, which may be a heresy, unsure)
- Ottolenghi's Sweet Summer Salad ([here](https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/sweet-summer-salad)) is an unbridled winner, beloved by every dinner-party guest. Looks beautiful and tastes just as good. Surprisingly easy, especially if you buy pre-cooked beets!
- Stephanie Alexander's chicken with red-wine vinegar and tomato from The Cook's Companion, online [here](https://www.stephaniealexander.com.au/what-to-cook/recipes/chicken-casserole-red-wine-vinegar-tomato/).
- Stephanie Alexander's lemon tart from The Cook's Companion, online [here](https://mybeachkitchen.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/stephanie-alexander-s-lemon-tart/).
