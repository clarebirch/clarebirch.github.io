_FYI: This is an old post from an old blog I kept in uni_

1. [The Words Men and Women Use When They Write About Love](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/upshot/modern-love-what-we-write-when-we-write-about-love.html) 
- Modern Love celebrated its 13th birthday this week, and they released a bunch of great pieces in celebration. This one was my favourite – a visual deconstruction of the words used in submissions, mapped across gender and success.
2. [The Unlikely Odds of Making It Big](https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/) 
- A little pessimistic, but very interesting – this is another data piece, investigating the number of bands who move up from playing small shows. Works best on desktop.
3. [The Louvre Abu Dhabi Lets In Light and, Finally, The Public](https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/100000005524840/the-louvre-abu-dhabi-lets-in-light-and-finally-the-public.html) 
- The New York Times does a daily “360” video, and this one is particularly great. Nothin’ much else to say tbh, I am in a mad rush.
4. [What We Talk About When We Talk About Australian Literature](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-australian-literature/) 
- Okay, hear me out. I know Austlit gets a bad wrap. I know. But it’s genuinely super interesting. I cleaned up my bookmarks bar this week and found this article from first year uni, so I’m sticking it here to inspire y’all to love Austlit. 
5. [The Numbers Are In: Ageing is Inevitable](https://cosmosmagazine.com/mathematics/the-numbers-are-in-ageing-is-inevitable) 
- This one doesn’t have to be pessimistic if you embrace ageing. I’m keen to age. Fight me.

And of course, the video that rocked my week: [Meryl Streep Meets Anna Wintour At Vogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW4wpGg64pE) (and they talk about women and Harvey Weinstein and journalism and truth in an age of ‘fake news’ and politics of distraction).
