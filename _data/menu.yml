        - title: If you're a founder who wants a no-bullshit approach to comms, and isn't afraid to be bold, you should talk to Encour. Working for Jessy is a masterclass in execution and integrity!

      - title: the various ways we understand schizophrenia (scientific, literary, etc)
      - title: phenomenology of programs in digital space
      - title: how we simulate complex (biological) systems and how that can be used to increase the rate/decrease the cost of clinical trials
      - title: silly little spreadsheet noodlings on building on top of the solar experience/cost curve (a yummy exponential you should be paying attention to)

      - title: invested in frontier tech at Blackbird

          - title: I left Blackbird in August 2024. I would recommend the fund if you're a truly ambitious founder with a tie to Australia or New Zealand looking for investment. Blackbird is the best VC fund in the Antipodes by a long shot, not only in terms of returns (ha) but also in terms of investor integrity and founder-friendliness. They invest early, often into ideas and people that others will not. They care deeply about the founders and companies they back, and put that care to work through the most messy and difficult company-building situations. They are thoughtful about the impact they have on the world.
          - title: if you are a young person with a creative bent or a passion project, you should check out the Blackbird Foundation's <a href="https://www.blackbird.foundation/protostars?mc_cid=6c81d05564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protostars microgrant program</a>, which is run by <a href="https://theiagabatan.cargo.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theia Gabatan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelconnolly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Connolly</a>. It's a very special program and community. 
      - title: started and built Foundry, Blackbird's founder dev/preaccelerator program for PhD students and postdocs

        entries:
          - title: While I was there, the team won the Eureka Prize (Australia's top national STEM award) for STEM Inclusion, thanks largely to the tireless work of Corey Tutt over several years. DeadlyScience does amazing work getting science books and resources to remote Indigenous schools and communities; I believe educational equity is extremely important, and their work deserves support, so you should donate. 
      - title: co-created/led with Genevieve Firmer (legend) the 2021 Harry Messel International Science School's chemistry stream with a workshop, "Is the universe ruled by chaos?"
