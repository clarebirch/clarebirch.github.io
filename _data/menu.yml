      - title: investing in frontier tech at Blackbird
        url: https://blackbird.vc/team/clare-birch
        entries:
          - title: I source new investments, run point on new and follow-on investments, do some light work with LPs (e.g. for coinvestment opportunities), and do portfolio support things (e.g. board shadowing work and fundraising support).

          - title: I've helped deploy >A$100M in rounds from preseed to Series E. 
      - title: building Foundry, the founder dev/preaccelerator program for PhD students I started at Blackbird
        url: https://blackbird.vc/foundry
        entries:
          - title: Foundry exists to empower Australian and Kiwi PhD students and EMCRs to start or join interesting companies. We don't believe in "research commercialisation". We believe in research talent.
          - title: We've run one Foundry cohort each year since 2022. We have an NPS > 70. The companies that have come out of Foundry have raised from top-tier VCs, been headhunted by YC, and Blackbird has invested in more of them than they have YC or Startmate companies in the time Foundry has existed (absolutely, but much more if you take this proportionally).
          - title: Foundry alumni that are active include <a href="https://www.aquila.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquila</a>, <a href="https://dromeda.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andromeda</a>, <a href="https://www.synbiote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synbiote</a>, <a href="https://unsloth.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsloth</a>, <a href="https://kitemagnetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kite Magnetics</a>, <a href="https://www.greendynamics.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GreenDynamics</a>, <a href="https://cellbauhaus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cell Bauhaus</a>, <a href="https://www.preview.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preview Health</a>, Graft AI, <a href="https://iceberg-quantum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iceberg</a>, and Twisted.
          - title: We wrote a Manifesto that did its job (ruffled some feathers, brought out some supporters, changed some minds).
      - title: helping the Australian Government build its quantum industry as a member of the National Quantum Advisory Committee

        entries:
          - title: we released <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/national-quantum-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia's first National Quantum Strategy</a> in 2023, which laid the groundwork for >$1B in investment into quantum things by the Commonwealth and State Governments.
