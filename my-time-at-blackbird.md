title: A quick summary of my time at Blackbird
---
I was an Associate at [Blackbird](https://blackbird.vc) from 2021 to 2024. In that time, I:
- Sourced 3 successful new investments, 
- Ran point on 21 successful new and follow-on investments amounting to >$100M investment from pre-seed to post-Series D, and
- Did some work with LPs (e.g. for coinvestment opportunities), and portfolio support things (e.g. board shadowing work and fundraising support)
- Started and ran [Foundry]()

Some media that documents my time at Blackbird:
- [Capital Brief](https://www.capitalbrief.com/article/blackbirds-scientist-in-residence-clare-birch-takes-flight-633885b5-0b03-4356-980b-c9b9e71d6822/preview/)'s article "Blackbird's deep tech doyenne Clare Birch takes flight" on my departure---"A well-liked and highly regarded Blackbird investor who served on Innovation Minister Ed Husic's quantum computing advisory board is leaving the firm for pastures new." (embarrassing!)
- [Cosmos Magazine](https://cosmosmagazine.com/people/culture/blackbird-scientist-in-residence/)'s article "Why would a company need a scientist-in-residence?" from sometime around when I started.
