<p>Emily Wilson’s translations of the Odyssey and the Iliad are great contributions to the canon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no perfect or “true” translation. However, we are fortunate to have many translations of ancient texts; they allow us to consider the language and literature from many vantage points. You should read many translations.</li>
  <li>Wilson’s translations are ambitious in form and in their context.</li>
  <li>They are also often lyrical and beautiful.</li>
  <li>The translator’s note for the Odyssey is worth a read. It’s clear that Wilson has questioned older biases in the translations. It’s also clear she has brought her own to the text. Both of these are fine (see the first point).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalEducation/comments/woixd8/comment/l88z73p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">The restrictions Wilson puts on herself in her translation of the Odyssey</a> are a result of the ambition. The syllabic + line restrictions conflict, however, and undermine the translation.</li>
  <li>Wilson clearly does not hate men generally or Homer specifically. What a bizarre thing to say.</li>
  <li>It is important that she’s the first woman to translate the texts and publish those translations. Don’t you think it’s strange that hadn’t happened yet?</li>
  <li>A lot of this discourse is clearly identity-driven backlash against an intelligent, hardworking person doing quality work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ungenerous reflections on The Discourse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People seem to need something to be written in a high register to think it is Good.</li>
  <li>People seem not to have read these translations past the first page of The Odyssey.</li>
  <li>People seem to really struggle with (ie. chuck tantrums when introduced to) the idea of a complex character; there is some sort of Disney-hero version of Odysseus living in people’s minds.</li>
  <li>People who say things like “Wilson hates Homer” show their hand. What a genuinely ridiculous, thoughtless thing to say.</li>

Weddings, funerals, big changes, small changes, new horizons, rest, great books, great music, etc. Every few months I look back at myself from 3 months ago and I do not recognise her.</p>

<p>I am delighted by how much great stuff—knowledge, media, culture, music, opinion, food, history, personality—there is to imbibe. The more I read, the more there is to read; the more I listen, the more there is to hear; the more I think, the more there is to consider and dream up. You could glut yourself on it—part of why creation is oh-so important. Good lesson for the year.</p>

<p>Anyway, these are the best things I read/watched/listened to/ate this year. I consumed a bunch of crap, but this is what I’d like to remember!</p>

<p>UPDATE at 2025/01/02: The Best Minds and Acid for the Children were my favourite books of 2024, but I thought I’d read them in 2023, so I didn’t include them! I’ve fixed this.

<p>Current word count: ~2.5k</p>

<p>This is a living (ie. incomplete, being edited, updated) <del>list of</del> reflection, list of lessons, advice, and experiments through my quarter-life crisis.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-this-update-november-2024">Notes on this update (November 2024)</h4>
<p>First, thank you much to the several people who have reached out to ask questions, chat, and help after reading this. It’s been a real pleasure meeting you!! Special thanks to <a href="https://x.com/josephnwalker?lang=en">Joe</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ArtirKel">José</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/alexeyguzey">Alexey</a>, in part for their mutual consistency in flying the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures">EV</a> Grantees/”Greater George Mason Co-Prosperity Sphere” flag. (kudos to <a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-scaling-people-by-claire-hughes?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-1-130267993">this</a> very sassy but witty blog for that bit)</p>

<p>The next chapter looks pretty great at this point. Very excited. It looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a research org (stealthy!)</li>
  <li>Working for a person I believe in and admire (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessyzwu">Jessy</a>) to help out in a little way in building an opinionated, courageous startup comms agency (<a href="https://encour.co/">Encour</a>)</li>
  <li>Independent research, crystallised into writing, on simulating molecules and stuff, computation, energy/climate, schizophrenia, and short-form PG-esque essays at <a href="https://clarevoyant.substack.com">Clarevoyant</a></li>
  <li>Doing music things, including using some of the stuff I’ve learned to help the local improvisational music association into <em>its</em> next chapter</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also updated the reflection below to represent my current thinking. I have a short meta-commentary on the process of reflection—please indulge.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen to put my thoughts online as I go <em>through</em> this journey because I believe that part of charting a course forward is leaving a path behind you for others to learn from (or follow). To do that well requires vulnerability and honesty.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of truth in reflection: the kind that exists in the short term (micro truth, truth in the moment) and the kind that emerges over a longer period (macro truth). The last version of this was written while I was very much “in the weeds” of processing and kicking off a values reset, and emphasised micro truths. Because of that, some parts were overweighted, and I was wrong about some things.</p>

<p>You can read a prior version on Github I think (version control rocks) but the point is: I’ve come out of the weeds with time and rest, so this updated reflection is closer to a macro truth. That’s the point of this put-it-online project!</p>
<h4 id="reflections">Reflections</h4>
<p>I like to think of the foundations of my self as having to do with learning, generosity, and rigour. I am most my <em>self</em> when I am learning and creating new things that are excellent (well executed, something to be proud of, novel) and that make other people’s lives much better.</p>

<p>I ticked those boxes over the past few years as an Investment Associate, but something was still missing.</p>

<p>I learned plenty about business, about a subset of frontier-tech markets, and (mostly) about people, working, and getting things done in a growing organisation. I learned about VC and fundraising, which I think will be a powerful tool. We created <a href="https://blackbird.vc/foundry">Foundry</a>, which is doing good things for ECRs in Australia and is something to be proud of. I broadened my horizons and grew up a bunch. I met some very ambitious people who continue to inspire me.</p>

<p>The missing part comes down to a few other things that are foundational to me:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Agency and ownership;</li>
  <li>Creativity;</li>
  <li>Challenge;</li>
  <li>Doing, rather than optimising;</li>
  <li>Ambition and opportunity for scale.</li>
</ol>

<p>I like the craft of early-stage investing at what I think is its best: clear and expert judgment in the face of huge uncertainty, building trust, and finding overlooked outlier individuals to whom to give cash-shaped opportunities.</p>

<p>However, it’s an optimisation or enablement layer, not a core layer; it’s not where I want to be right now. I believe in building substantive expertise—the ability to understand most every task in the stack before making decisions about it.</p>

<p>A person I like and admire asked me recently what my number one passion is. I have never thought of myself as a singular-passion kind of person. I have lusted after it—to be single-minded in devotion to a single thing, whether it’s a god or a mission or whatever. I’ve put it as this in an earlier version of this reflection:</p>

<p>(start)
The thing that makes it all worthwhile. The thing that isn’t you, that is part of you but is for everyone. The soulful thing. George Bernard Shaw puts it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in a quote that I used to have hanging above my desk, Marie Curie <a href="https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/who/our-history/marie-curie-the-scientist">describes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Flea, in his memoir <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acid-Children-Memoir-Flea/dp/1455530530"><em>Acid for the Children</em></a>, puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing special about me, we’ve all got our own sacred place, but to access it, your mission must be pure and your aim true. Just a little thought of trying to use it for a power tool, a career move, and the process becomes corrupted. You gotta go for the joy, the pain, the adventure, the search, the journey to love. I learned that from Kurt Vonnegut. You have to be willing to dedicate your life to that journey, not as a means to an end, but just as an opportunity to trip the fuck out. Ya gotta suspend all self-judgement, and embrace all. The reward is the journey itself. And that’s how I became the bass player I’m still trying tobe. Just exploring for a sense of purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(end)</p>

<p>After this period of reflection and experimentation, though, I’ve found that I am a singular passion person. It’s just been a little hard to describe. I just like building people-machines that solve ugly, science-related problems. That’s the higher level. Requires expertise at all the lower levels. Requires excellence. Etc.</p>

<p>I’m a technical people person: technical detail nourishes me, I love people and am surprisingly good with them (when I don’t piss them off with too-honest short-term stream-of-consciousness nonsense), and I feel most at home with “technical” (ie. in the weeds, in the detail) people.</p>

<p>So that’s when I’m “in the groove”, per an earlier version of this:</p>

<p>(start)
And because I wasn’t quite doing my thing I usually wasn’t in the groove, which again—Flea describes in <em>Acid for the Children</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I’m rocking a groove, there is only nature working, ain’t no one gonna rock it harder than me. Free from all prison of my mind’s construct, I am a fucking mama grizzly bear protecting her cubs, and I don’t care if I die. I trust my animal instinct completely. I let go of every thought, let go of all the world, and KILL the groove. The hurt and pain in my heart is my ticket to fly, I surrender all earthly desires in the moment, when it’s time to rock and tap the source. I gotta be the groove and nothing else, fuck the world so I can uplift the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aside—what a groove that is!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KE9t6DAvdtQ?si=69Iqz0YQnn9jgrG9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I think of this—being in the groove, in some way in the pocket—as the same flavour of thing as C.S. Lewis’s <a href="http://ktf.cuni.cz/~linhb7ak/Meditation-in-a-Toolshed.pdf"><em>looking along the beam</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was standing today in the dark toolshed. The sun was shining outside and through the crack at the top of the door there came a sunbeam. From where I stood that beam of light, with the specks of dust floating in it, was the most striking thing in the place. Everything else was almost pitch-black. I was seeing the beam, not seeing things by it.</p>

  <p>Then I moved, so that the beam fell on my eyes. Instantly the whole previous picture vanished. I saw no toolshed, and (above all) no beam. Instead I saw, framed in the irregular cranny at the top of the door, green leaves moving on the branches of a tree outside and beyond that, 90 odd million miles away, the sun. Looking along the beam, and looking at the beam are very different experiences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(end)</p>

<p>The best lesson I’ve learned over the past couple of months has been recognising what it feels like when I’m trying to do something because I think I <em>ought to</em> be doing it. It’s been fun to put that instinct on ice. It’s the wrong kind of people pleasing, and it’s rooted in insecurity. But relinquishing it has meant (1) I’m back to doing, not optimising, and (2) I feel oh-so light.</p>
<h4 id="experiments">Experiments</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Started a two-pronged writing practice
    <ul>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>The first prong is journalling—which I’ve done on and off for a long time, but hadn’t done consistently for the past couple of years. It’s very valuable for character development (ie. not being a shit—being incapable of genuine reflection is one of my few “red flags” in a person), and autobiographical memory.</li>
      <li>The second is the note taking –&gt; full written piece pipeline, which is more nascent for me. I found myself trying to write a full piece from a blank page, with minimal planning or ongoing research. Turns out if you take descriptive notes, capture thoughts, etc, and nourish them with exploration, and research over time, writing becomes way easier.  You also need to relinquish the desire to be <em>correct</em> (or the fear of being <em>incorrect</em> for a bit; rigour is a different kind of process.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Started a personal research project on schizophrenia

          <li>Turns out Sydney has a cool music scene now. Who knew!</li>
          <li>Tom asked for my jazz schedule. The baseline is Monday Night Confessions, Wednesday Jazz at the Crix, and rarely Thursday at the Botany View Hotel. I’ve got a list going of the better venues and am starting to keep an eye on their schedules.</li>
          <li>Because I listed the NYC ones I guess I should list some of the Sydney ones:

      <li>We went to Culburra for a few days and then to Bundanoon with a larger group of friends.

At the very least, I want to listen to lots of music and read lots and yap.</li>
      <li>Ben wrote a murder mystery for the group (the second one he’s done, having inadvertently recreated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubensha">Jubensha</a> late last year) and it went down an absolute treat.

<p>It was introduced to me on a semi-drunken night out at Quantum Australia during a conversation about PhDs and finding your life’s work. The person I spoke with was, himself, Christian. I had forgotten that the deeper-thinking apologeticists are also astute observers of humanity. Such people often have the uncanny ability to cut through you with honesty and kindness—a rarity I admire immensely.</p>

<p>He thought I would benefit from Unlearning Perfectionism (am I so transparent?). After two sentences I was quite rapt. Pained and relieved at once. Perhaps most current to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Perfectionism endures because it has its merits, and we must see these clearly as well. It establishes a high standard and feeds on a source of intense energy, i.e. the fear of losing our identity and self-worth. So it is no surprise that some of the world’s luminaries have made contracts with it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sans the navel gazing you might expect here, I will say I am focusing on excellence rather than perfection currently, with some structure along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One alternative with a similar flavor is excellence, which differs in two respects:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Where perfectionism focuses on achieving, excellence focuses on pursuing. Success and failure aren’t ever in our full control. All we can control is what we choose to do right now, in this moment. Our attention shifts from outcomes to process.</li>
    <li>Where perfectionism focuses on fixed outcomes, excellence focuses on better outcomes. Any real situation can always be improved. Since there is no perfect outcome, perfection is impossible.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Process over outcomes; systems over goals; growth mindset over fixed mindset; satisficing over maximizing; professionalism over amateurism; boring fundamentals over flashy tricks; response over reaction; agency over passivity; presence over regret and worry. No matter what you call it, the distinction is the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am an Associate Venture Capitalist. This is a title that, if you knew me two years ago, would make you laugh. It is, ironically, a journey of <em>slow</em>, deep learning in a fast environment that I am generally enjoying—-with caveats and battles, of course, as you always find in situations of love. It is not a journey that survives under the stifling gables of perfectionism. At the end, I am loving seeing this version of myself emerge.</p>]]></content><author><name>Clare Birch</name></author><category term="oldblog yawyr" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been mulling over Arun Prasad’s ‘Unlearning Perfectionism’ for the past couple of months.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">You Are What You Read 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/you-are-what-you-read-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You Are What You Read 5" /><published>2020-01-06T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2020-01-06T00:00:00+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/you-are-what-you-read-5</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/you-are-what-you-read-5.html"><![CDATA[<p><em>FYI: This is an old post from an old blog I kept in uni</em></p>

<p>Fill your brain with good today. As I empty my time of social media (difficult), I try to fill it again with challenging, enjoyable Good (this has mostly meant Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but we’re getting there). Here are some (non-Buffy) things that have stood out.</p>

      <li>John Green reviews an aspect of this strange human experience of ours: Auld Lang Syne, my preferred holiday song. Reflecting on his friendship with author Amy Krouse Rosenthal, who passed away in 2017, Green remarks, “…we are here. Meaning that we are together, and not alone…that we are, that we exist…that we are here, that a series of astonishing unlikelihoods has made us possible, and here possible. We might never know why we are here, but we can still proclaim in hope that we are here. I don’t think such hope is foolish or idealistic or misguided. I believe that hope is, for lack of a better word, true. We live in hope that life will get better and, more importantly, that it will go on. That love will survive, even though we will not. As Emily Dickinson put it, ‘Hope is the thing with feathers / that perches in the soul / and sings the tune without the words / and never stops at all.’” It is the kind of controlled meandering we have come to expect from Green. It is lovely and heartbreaking and hopeful.</li>

<p><a href="https://clarejoy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c0c3982-r1-06-6.jpg?w=1568"><img src="https://clarejoy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c0c3982-r1-06-6.jpg?w=1568" alt="A close shot of jacarandas in front of a sandstone building at the University of Sydney, on film" /></a></p>

<p>I recently had the honour of giving the Address of the Faculty Scholar at our annual Faculty of Science awards night. I’ll admit I was petrified for days (weeks, even) leading up to the event, unsure of what message I thought was most important to get across. I settled on the below. Enjoy. Don’t judge (too hard).</p>

<hr />

<p>Good evening Dean, academic and professional staff, guests, and most importantly, students.</p>

<p>What I want to talk to you about tonight is strictly speaking not on science. It’s rather about making science better, about stories and diversity.</p>

<p>You see, I entered Sydney University with no intention of studying science, a head filled with visions of Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society, and the deepest conviction that I was going to become a desk-stomping, poetry-reciting English teacher.</p>

<p>A child of the foster system, I know from a great deal of personal experience the power of strong mentorship and stability. I have been lucky to have these in brilliant foster parents and teachers throughout most of my life. My motivation was simple: I was going to change the world by changing worlds, just as mine had been.</p>

<p>I was wrong. This became very clear to me when, at a welcome afternoon tea a little way in, I found myself complaining about my degree in exquisite detail to a lovely blonde lady who seemed altogether too interested in my input. A few minutes later, she introduced herself to the group as none other than our esteemed Chancellor, Belinda Hutchinson, and I promptly decided to change my course.</p>

<p>I’ve changed degrees twice, overall, and majors uncountably many times. I’ve dabbled in English and neuroscience and Arabic, and always come home to chemistry. I’m not telling you all this so that I come across as delightfully capricious or approachable or comfortably abject. The fact is that I am not yet very old, though I certainly feel it sometimes, and I am frankly not sure I have much to offer you by way of sage wisdom.</p>

<p>All I have are stories like this, and some that are a little more serious.</p>

<p>But stories have been more than enough for me in mentoring and leadership. See, stories have the most remarkable, sometimes dangerous, power of taking on their own lives while also shaping the world around us. Fiction is an amazing thing, but as scientists we have an incredible tool in our individual stories to encourage genuine change in our fields.</p>

<p>Your own narrative is a path carved through your own experience; it contains an abundance of data on what to do, what not to do, how to do it. This is why it’s important that I tell you tonight that I was fostered: in the UK, while 50% of the general population will make it to university, only 6% of people with experience in care will. I would not have made it here without incredible mentors and support and, importantly, a brother who part-carved the path before me. His story, always a step ahead of but similar to mine, brought the possibility of university to life for me: he was the only other person I knew with a similar background who had taken this step. In many ways, his story made mine possible. When you can look ahead and see someone, seeing yourself in the 6% becomes more conceivable. Their path makes yours clearer, realer.</p>

<p>As science-doers, we can be hesitant to tell our individual stories: our work must stand on its own, we are often terrified of showing weakness or admitting failure, we are deeply concerned with fitting in and keeping up in a field mired in tradition but changing increasingly rapidly. This is important now more than ever: not only can our stories pave the way for greater diversity, they can help to rebuild trust in the public eye. We have a moral imperative to tackle the groundswell of anti-intellectualism that is wreaking havoc on our climate and our health. Being emphatically diverse encourages trust and empathy. It’s not a nicety, it’s a necessity.</p>

<p>So this is it: students, you are in the process of writing a story that will change lives. Science needs your stories: your cultures, your genders, your sexualities, your cognitive differences, your opinions, your activism, your hobbies, your arts. It needs your experiences with mental health, with perfectionism, with failure. There is more, of course: bureaucracy and ingrained, often very physical, inaccessibility that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. But your voice will change the culture and structures that hold others back.</p>

<p>I want to leave you with the quote that made me decide to pursue science. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-All-Stardust-Scientists-ebook/dp/B00BBF8FLO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34TNTQV3Q0LHQ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9d665duWc-GDw0Qg44APi3dqkwVY7SAD7MlvAoPwOFVP0CK-StiHEu3g8ADZcAJ0L3gnssvYgbSAFKzTtXan1x4Y4dg-ueH1PO_v72jf-SdQYhPWrk1j_8HsmYeIywaXzlHF13TRaS7fELCtgFrrpIOE3v1nAUWK3JfEYUSdZu5-9x2-FI5Y5Iva0ZEXnVi3hChJYMXxKsMDUOzS4wsrLek7j9KMkAEEoCKz4tfLMag.JSY-MIzrn2WgU2Nf8Q7CxC3Jd9XIkCyHgDTXgg_ZNv4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=we+are+all+stardust&amp;qid=1724548470&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=we+are+all+stardu%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C372&amp;sr=1-1">An interviewer asks Roald Hoffmann</a>–my personal favourite chemist, if that’s a normal thing to have-—what makes him so “unusually successful” (in my opinion, this is a fairly reasonable description of a Nobel Prize winner). Hoffmann says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Maybe a better ability to empathise with other people. I’ve always had a good sense of what difficulties my colleagues in the lab are facing—even if they haven’t verbalised them. And I’ve then solved those particular problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So students, do your best science. Continue to be exceptional. And while you do, remember that empathy can empower the human spirit just as much as discovery. Remember that science needs you, needs your stories. Remember to speak up. You never know who might hear. Thank you.</p>

<p>Happy International Women’s Day!</p>

<p>Today is a great chance to celebrate the women in your life – your mentors, mothers, inspirations, friends, colleagues, sisters, strangers…</p>

<p>It’s also an opportunity to acknowledge that the difficulties that come with womanhood are vastly varied across the planet, and that as women in the Global North we have the ability to enact real, effective, positive change in the lives of women across the globe.</p>

<p>As an individual, you can do more than you realise. I’ve compiled a list of places to which you might like to consider contributing today. You obviously don’t have to – it’s just something I hope you’ll think about. There are plenty of other worthwhile causes, of course; these are just a few that I know and support.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">Give directly</a> to a woman in extreme poverty in Kenya or Uganda, so she can support her family as she thinks best. GiveDirectly is an initiative backed by GiveWell, Google, and pretty decent evidence.</li>
  <li>Support <a href="https://learningpartnership.org/">Women’s Learning Partnership</a>, a UN-approved partnership of 20 autonomous organisations that promote women’s leadership and human rights in the Global South.</li>
  <li>Donate to, or volunteer at, <a href="https://sanctuaryhousing.org.au/">one of Sydney’s many domestic violence shelters</a>.</li>
  <li>An obstetric fistula is an injury that can occur in childbirth. It’s no longer an issue, for the most part, in developed countries, but due to poverty-related stunting and a lack of medical care, it’s still a huge problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Donations to <a href="https://www.fistulafoundation.org/">The Fistula Foundation</a> can provide access to a life-changing surgery to reverse the effects of fistula.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.a21.org/">The A21 Foundation</a> works to eliminate sexual trafficking and slavery, and are always in need of support. It’s run by Christine Caine, whose passion for the cause is truly infectious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of a wedding (congrats Em and Euon!) and the general temporal disorientation brought about by exam season, this is like 24 hours late. These articles and videos have been a welcome relief; new information is the closest I’m getting to swanning around a different country, at least for now. So please, enjoy!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I first came across Chinua Achebe in a Lit Theory class last year. ‘<a href="https://polonistyka.amu.edu.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/259954/Chinua-Achebe,-An-Image-of-Africa.-Racism-in-Conrads-Heart-of-Darkness.pdf">An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness</a>‘ was the first critical theory piece I enjoyed – Achebe’s writing is crisp and clear and engaging, carrying his passion and insight in a way that no other crit I’ve read has managed.

      <li>This article is a banger. I love it.

      <li>Literally just what it says it is. Tensions have been escalating between Zimbabwe’s government (dictatorial, run by Pres Robert Mugabe) and its military since its Vice President was exiled last week. It’s still uncertain what’s going to happen, but news sites are calling it an “apparent coup.” You can also follow along on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/15/heres-whats-happening-in-zimbabwe/?utm_term=.b92d239b0bc0">The Washington Post</a>.</li>

      <li>What a title! This is a Modern Love piece that, for me, was a comfort. Underpinning its central coincidence is a gentle lesson in impermanence. Your life is long; many people will walk through it; you will learn a lot from them and, ultimately, it will be okay.</li>

I am a big fan. He’s also done one on what makes Independence Day so great, which you should totally watch if we’re going to be mildly civil towards each other.</li>

      <li>This is a lovely little summary of the history of satellites, and a gorgeous (albeit glitchy) example of data journalism. Just make sure you scroll slowly. I found the Pudding on my hunt for some more content sources, and I have not been disappointed thus far.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>This is another one from The Pudding, which I actually stole from my brother’s Facebook wall. Not even mad. It’s mathsy but also designy – I’m a big, big fan.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/obama-the-conservationist">Obama The Conservationist</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Honestly, I used this as a source in an essay I wrote(/am still writing) this week. Nothing like a lil Obama love to make you feel better about the state of the world. A couple of notes: NOT “Obama, the Conversationalist” or “The Obama Conservationist” though these are also valid article ideas. Also totally gave up on the design for the story screen for this one.</li>
