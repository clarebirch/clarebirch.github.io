title: Physical intuitions for energy and power things
---
Motivations:
- Good physical intuitions are generally valuable to have. I studied chemistry and my volumetric intuition is off the charts. This is very useful: I can always pick the perfect Tupperware for leftovers, basically to the mL. 
- Anyway, you should pay special attention to exponentials and power laws. The solar cost/experience/learning curves are really [worth paying attention to](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/05/22/the-solar-industrial-revolution-is-the-biggest-investment-opportunity-in-history/). However, if you want to understand and/or speak to energy stuff, you need to have a solid intuition for orders of magnitude in energy and power. 

Anchor points for energy intuitions (some from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)), leading into others from elsewhere):

- **Joules:** Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit for energy of a cosmic ray coming from a distant source (8 J)
	- **10s of Joules:** flash of a point-and-shoot camera (10 J), most energetic cosmic ray ever detected (50 J)
	- **100s of Joules:** energy of a regulation baseball thrown at the MLB average pitch speed (125 J); energy to melt 1g (~1 mL) of ice (330 J); work done to lift an average-weight man one metre on earth (801 J).
- **Kilojoules (kJ):** food calories (1 kcal = 4.2 kJ); kinetic energy of a bullet out of an "elephant gun" (7 kJ); energy of an alkaline AA battery (9 kJ)
	- **10s of kJ:** energy released by metabolising 1g of protein or carbs (17 kJ) or fat (38 kJ), or from combustion of 1g of gasoline (40-50 kJ)
	- 100s of kJ: 100g carrot (139 kJ)
- **Kilowatt hours (kWh; 3,600 kJ to a kWh):** running a window AC unit for 1-2 hours; a full cycle of a modern dishwasher; energy released in explosion of 1 kg of TNT (4.2 MJ / 1.17 kWh); recommended daily energy intake for a moderately active adult woman (8.4 MJ / 2,000 kcal / 2.3 kWh) and man (11 MJ / 2,600 kcal / 3.05 kWh)
	- 10s of kWh: Tesla Powerwall 3 energy capacity (13.5 kWh); typical US household's daily electricity usage for everything *except* heating/cooling; avg Australian household daily electricity usage (3 people = 18.7 kWh/day, 4 = 21.4 kWh/day, 5+ = 25.4 kWh/day); Tesla Model 3's battery capacity (~75 kWh); energy from the combustion of a cubic metre of natural gas (11.1 kWh / 40 MJ)
	- 100s of kWh: about a week of a typical household's electricity use; energy (thunder!) in an average lightning bolt (~278 kWh / 1 GJ)
- **Megawatt hours (1,000 kWh to a MWh):** monthly consumption of a small apartment building, enough to power 500-1000 average American homes for an hour (1 MWh).
	- 10s of MWh: daily consumption of a medium-sized office building
	- 100s of MWh: daily consumption of a small factory or data centre
- **Gigawatt hours (1,000 MWh to a GWh):** 
	- 10s of GWh: 
	- 100s of GWh: 1h peak electricity demand in US between 2019 and 2024 (6pm EDT July 15 2024, 745 GWh); 1h peak electricity demand on Western Interconnect between 2019 and 2024 (July 10, 141 GWh) ([sources](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php))
- Terawatt hours (1,000 GWh to a TWh):
	- 10s of TWh: 
	- 100s of TWh: 
	- 1000s of TWh: US energy generation between January and July (2,500 TWh in 2024)

The watt (W) is the SI unit of power (or radiant flux). 1 W is equal to 1 joule per second. 

Anchor points for power intuitions:

- **Watts:** phone charger (5 W), wifi (6 W)
	- **10s of watts:** computer, digital exercise bike, MacBook Air M3 charger (35 W), amplifier that's good enough for my little apartment (30 W)
	- **100s of watts:** TV (50-200 W), fridge (300-800 W), microwave (600-1,000 W), washing machine (400-1,400 W)
- **Kilowatts (1000s of watts):** oven/stove (2-5 kW), space heater (1.5 kW), heat pump (0.5-7.5 kW), clothes dryer (1.5-5 kW), Dyson Supersonic hairdryer (1.6 kW, about average), EV charger (7.2 kW), average American residential home draw ([1.2 kW](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php))
	- **10s of kW:** Tesla home Wall Connector output (22 kW) and Powerwall On-Grid and Backup (up to 10 kW)
	- **100s of kW:** Tesla Supercharger output (250 kW): 
- Megawatts (1000s of kilowatts): average data centre (5-10 MW, via the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-the-data-centre-and-ai-boom-could-mean-for-the-energy-sector)) 
	- 10s of MW: 
	- 100s of MW: hyperscale data centre (100+ MW, via the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-the-data-centre-and-ai-boom-could-mean-for-the-energy-sector))
- Gigawatts (1000s of megawatts):
